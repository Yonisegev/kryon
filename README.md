NGRX from scratch (I do know flux and redux)

Strongly typed store

Presentational and container components (shell is container, list, preview etc are presentational) so I can use onPush aswell

Clean code

Use of the async pipe to avoid having to unsub manually and cause memory leaks

Used debounce when searching

Use of directives and pipes

Added memo to the fibonacci function
